Ansible is one of several options available for configuration management. It is
open source and free software (GPLv3 licence) and you can follow the development
process on [GitHub](https://github.com/ansible). The company behind Ansible was
acquired by RedHat in October 2015, but this doesn't appear to have had an
impact on development, and if anything it is likely to make life easier for
system administrators already using RHEL, CentOS and OpenStack.

In case you were wondering, an ansible is a fictional machine for communicating
over large distances. It was first coined in *Rocannon's World* by Ursula K. Le
Guin, and is used by other science fiction novels.
