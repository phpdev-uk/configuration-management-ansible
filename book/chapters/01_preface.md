# Preface

## About the author

#include "../common/author-bio.md"

## Who is this book for?

The intended audience for this book is system administrators who are familiar
with managing Linux machines but are new to configuration management or Ansible
(or both).

This book will take you from an introduction to Ansible up to an intermediate
level. By the end of the book you should be able to manage Linux machines using
Ansible and extend its functionality through the creation of modules.

## What isn't covered?

Whilst we will create our own Ansible module, we will not cover contributing to
the Ansible software or Core or Extras modules.

## Why this book?

There are already lots of existing Ansible books and tutorials available, so
why write another one?

First and foremost, I find that writing a book, tutorial or workshop helps me
to improve my understanding of the topic (although delivering a workshop is
even better).

Secondly, one thing that I learnt from my time at university (as a student and
later a member of staff) is that there is no one teaching method which works for
all teachers and students. Sometimes a student can be totally confused by a
topic discussed in a lecture, only to suddenly understand it when a subtly
different explanation is given by someone else. If you've struggled struggled
with other books, perhaps this one will help you get to grips with Ansible.
This works both ways -- if you find the way I explain things to be unhelpful or
confusing, you may find another resource to be more enlightening.

Finally, I'm hoping that if you find this book useful, you'll consider hiring me
to deliver some Ansible training at your organisation.
