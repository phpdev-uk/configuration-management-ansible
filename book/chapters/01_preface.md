# Preface

## About the author

#include "../common/author-bio.md"

## Who is this book for?

The intended audience for this book is system administators who are familiar
with managing Linux machines but are new to configuration management or Ansible
(or both).

This book will take you from an introduction to Ansible up to an intermediate
level. By the end of the book you should be able to manage Linux machines using
Ansible and extend its functionality through the creation of modules.

## What isn't covered?

Whilst we will create our own Ansible module, we will not cover contributing to
the Ansible software or Core or Extras modules.
